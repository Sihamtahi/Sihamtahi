I am  a software engineer student at ESI Algiers who is passionate about creating clean, unique, elegant and functional apps. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Flutter, Kotlin  and .Net core.


I’m currently Learning 🔭 how to use APIs with <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com">AsyncAPI</a>  and  <a href="https://www.openapis.org">OpenAPI</a>  initiatives & the Event-Driven APIs ⚡⚡. My project is about crating choreogrphies using events between two or more applications with pub/sub pattern.
